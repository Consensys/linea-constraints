;; The address trimming module does two things: (i) reduce 256bit
;; addresses into u160 addresses (i.e. modulo 2^160); (b) identify
;; addresses of precompiles.
;;
;; The need for this function arises as some EVM opcodes take an u256
;; stack argument requires trimming to be interpreted as an address.
;; Likewise, when computing a deployment address associated with an
;; invocation of a CREATE-type, the raw KECCAK hash must be trimmed.
;;
;; The following opcodes may trigger it:
;;
;; * BALANCE
;; * EXTCODESIZE / EXTCODECOPY / EXTCODEHASH
;; * CALL / CALLCODE / STATICCALL
;; * SELFDESTRUCT
;; * DELEGATECALL
;;
;; NOTE: the function currently only returns the high word of the
;; trimmed address, since the low word is unchanged.
;; NOTE2: once issue is fixed in go-corset, we will be able to recombine trm_london and trm_osaka
